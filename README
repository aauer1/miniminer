MiniMiner One                            Copyright 2013 by Andreas Auer

It is a single Avalon ASIC Bitcoin miner powered by the USB port. I 
designed it as an initial project in the Bitcoin community.

Subdirectories:

- pcb:
  This is the schematic and layout file for the PCB. You have to use
  Cadsoft Eagle to open it.

- firmware:
  The firmware for the microcontroller is based on the LUFA USB stack
  for Atmel microcontrollers.
  To compile it, enter the LUFA-120730/Projects/AvalonBTC directory
  and type "make". You need the avr-gcc to compile it.

- bfgminer-driver:
  This directory includes the driver files for bfgminer. You have to 
  copy it to the bfgminer directory and modify the configure.ac file
  to get it compiled. 
  The driver is old and not compatible with an actual version of 
  bfgminer. It was developed with bfgminer 3.1.x. To run it on a newer
  version you have to modify it massively!
